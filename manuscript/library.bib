  abstract = {Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the main platform for production of biotherapeutics in the biopharmaceutical industry. However, relatively little is known about the metabolism of CHO cells in cell culture. In this work, metabolism of CHO cells was studied at the growth phase and early stationary phase using isotopic tracers and mass spectrometry. CHO cells were grown in fed-batch culture over a period of six days. On days 2 and 4, [1,2-(13)C] glucose was introduced and the labeling of intracellular metabolites was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at 6, 12 and 24h following the introduction of tracer. Intracellular metabolic fluxes were quantified from measured extracellular rates and (13)C-labeling dynamics of intracellular metabolites using non-stationary (13)C-metabolic flux analysis ((13)C-MFA). The flux results revealed significant rewiring of intracellular metabolic fluxes in the transition from growth to non-growth, including changes in energy metabolism, redox metabolism, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and anaplerosis. At the exponential phase, CHO cell metabolism was characterized by a high flux of glycolysis from glucose to lactate, anaplerosis from pyruvate to oxaloacetate and from glutamate to Î±-ketoglutarate, and cataplerosis though malic enzyme. At the stationary phase, the flux map was characterized by a reduced flux of glycolysis, net lactate uptake, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway flux, and reduced rate of anaplerosis. The fluxes of pyruvate dehydrogenase and TCA cycle were similar at the exponential and stationary phase. The results presented here provide a solid foundation for future studies of CHO cell metabolism for applications such as cell line development and medium optimization for high-titer production of recombinant proteins.},

A serious drawback of the flux estimation method in current use is that it does not produce confidence limits for the estimated fluxes. Without this information it is difficult to interpret flux results and expand the physiological significance of flux studies. To address this shortcoming we derived analytical expressions of flux sensitivities with respect to isotope measurements and measurement errors. These tools allow the determination of local statistical properties of fluxes and relative importance of measurements. Furthermore, we developed an efficient algorithm to determine accurate flux confidence intervals and demonstrated that confidence intervals obtained with this method closely approximate true flux uncertainty. In contrast, confidence intervals approximated from local estimates of standard deviations are inappropriate due to inherent system nonlinearities. We applied these methods to analyze the statistical significance and confidence of estimated gluconeogenesis fluxes from human studies with [U-13C]glucose as tracer and found true limits for flux estimation in specific human isotopic protocols.},

A subclass of molecular dioxygenases is the histone demethylase enzymes, which are characterized by the presence of a Jumanji-C (JmjC) domain. Hypoxia can alter chromatin, but whether this is a direct effect on JmjC-histone demethylases or due to other mechanisms is unknown. Here, we report that hypoxia induces a rapid and hypoxia-inducible factor-independent induction of histone methylation in a range of human cultured cells. Genomic locations of histone-3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and H3K36me3 after a brief exposure of cultured cells to hypoxia predict the cell's transcriptional response several hours later. We show that inactivation of one of the JmjC-containing enzymes, lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A), mimics hypoxia-induced cellular responses. These results demonstrate that oxygen sensing by chromatin occurs via JmjC-histone demethylase inhibition.},

Using this system, a competition/screening assay was devised to search for factors that bind to specific regions of polysome-associated c-myc mRNA and thereby alter its half-life. mRNA stability was first assayed in reactions containing exogenous competitor RNAs corresponding to portions of c-myc mRNA itself. The addition of a 182-nucleotide sense strand fragment from the carboxy-terminal portion of the c-myc-coding region destabilized c-myc mRNA by at least eightfold. This RNA fragment had no effect on the stability of other mRNAs tested. Moreover, c-myc mRNA was not destabilized in reactions containing unrelated competitor RNAs or sense strand RNA from the c-myc 5' region. Polysome-associated globin mRNA containing the c-myc-coding region segment in-frame was also destabilized in vitro by the 182-nucleotide RNA. As determined by UV-cross-linking experiments, the 182-nucleotide RNA fragment was recognized by and bound to an approximately 75-kD polysome-associated protein. On the basis of these data plus Northern blotting analyses of c-myc mRNA decay products, we suggest that the approximately 75-kD protein is normally bound to a c-myc-coding region determinant and protects that region of the mRNA from endonuclease attack. Possible links between the protective protein, translation, ribosome pausing, and c-myc mRNA turnover are discussed.},

QA defines all the planned and systematic activities implemented before samples are collected, to provide confidence that a subsequent analytical process will fulfil predetermined requirements for quality. QC can be defined as the operational techniques and activities used to measure and report these quality requirements after data acquisition. AIM OF REVIEW: This tutorial review will guide the reader through the use of system suitability and QC samples, why these samples should be applied and how the quality of data can be reported. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: System suitability samples are applied to assess the operation and lack of contamination of the analytical platform prior to sample analysis. Isotopically-labelled internal standards are applied to assess system stability for each sample analysed. Pooled QC samples are applied to condition the analytical platform, perform intra-study reproducibility measurements (QC) and to correct~mathematically for systematic errors. Standard reference materials and long-term reference QC samples are applied for inter-study and inter-laboratory assessment of data.},

While much is known about the cellular transcriptional response to ischemia, much less is known about the posttranscriptional response to oxygen and glucose deprivation. The goal of this project was to investigate one such posttranscriptional response, the regulation of mRNA stability. To that end, we have identified several novel ischemia-related mRNAs that are synergistically stabilized by oxygen and glucose deprivation including VEGF, MYC, MDM2, and CYR61. This increase in mRNA half-life requires the synergistic effects of both low oxygen (1\%) as well as low glucose (â¤ 1~g/L) conditions. Oxygen or glucose deprivation alone fails to initiate the response, as exposure to either high glucose (4~g/L) or normoxic conditions inhibits the response. Furthermore, in response to hypoxia/hypoglycemia, the identified mRNAs are released from the RNA binding protein KHSRP which likely contributes to their stabilization.},

Results show (i) wild-type Hep3B cells increase ROS generation during hypoxia (1. 5\% O2) or CoCl2 incubation, (ii) Hep3B cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA (rho0 cells) fail to respire, fail to activate mRNA for erythropoietin, glycolytic enzymes, or vascular endothelial growth factor during hypoxia, and fail to increase ROS generation during hypoxia; (iii) rho0 cells increase ROS generation in response to CoCl2 and retain the ability to induce expression of these genes; and (iv) the antioxidants pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate and ebselen abolish transcriptional activation of these genes during hypoxia or CoCl2 in wild-type cells, and abolish the response to CoCl2 in rho degrees cells. Thus, hypoxia activates transcription via a mitochondria-dependent signaling process involving increased ROS, whereas CoCl2 activates transcription by stimulating ROS generation via a mitochondria-independent mechanism.},

  abstract = {Vascular remodeling and smooth muscle cell proliferation are hallmark pathogenic features of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). Alterations in the metabolism of l-arginine via arginase and nitric oxide synthase play a critical role in the endothelial dysfunction seen in PAH. l-arginine metabolism by arginase produces l-ornithine and urea. l-ornithine is a precursor for polyamine and proline synthesis, ultimately leading to an increase in cellular proliferation. Given the integral role of the smooth muscle layer in the pathogenesis of hypoxia-induced PAH, we hypothesized that hypoxia would increase cellular proliferation via arginase induction in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (hPASMC). We found that arginase II mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased in cultured hPASMC exposed to 1\% O(2) for 24 and 48 h, which coincided with an increase in arginase activity at 48 h. There were no hypoxia-induced changes in levels of arginase I mRNA or protein in cultured hPASMC. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in more than one and a half times as many viable cells after 120 h than normoxic exposure. The addition of the arginase inhibitor, S-(2-boronoethyl)-l-cysteine, completely prevented both the hypoxia-induced increase in arginase activity and proliferation in hPASMC. Furthermore, transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting arginase II in hPASMC resulted in knockdown of arginase II protein levels and complete prevention of the hypoxia-induced cellular proliferation. These data support our hypothesis that hypoxia increases proliferation of hPASMC through the induction of arginase II.},

  abstract = {The branched chain amino acids (BCAA) valine, leucine and isoleucine have been implicated in a number of diseases including obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, although the mechanisms are still poorly understood. Adipose tissue plays an important role in BCAA homeostasis by actively metabolizing circulating BCAA. In this work, we have investigated the link between BCAA catabolism and fatty acid synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using parallel 13C-labeling experiments, mass spectrometry and model-based isotopomer data analysis. Specifically, we performed parallel labeling experiments with four fully 13C-labeled tracers, [U-13C]valine, [U-13C]leucine, [U-13C]isoleucine and [U-13C]glutamine. We measured mass isotopomer distributions of fatty acids and intracellular metabolites by GC-MS and analyzed the data using the isotopomer spectral analysis (ISA) framework. We demonstrate that 3T3-L1 adipocytes accumulate significant amounts of even chain length (C14:0, C16:0 and C18:0) and odd chain length (C15:0 and C17:0) fatty acids under standard cell culture conditions. Using a novel GC-MS method, we demonstrate that propionyl-CoA acts as the primer on fatty acid synthase for the production of odd chain fatty acids. BCAA contributed significantly to the production of all fatty acids. Leucine and isoleucine contributed at least 25\% to lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool, and valine and isoleucine contributed 100\% to lipogenic propionyl-CoA pool. Our results further suggest that low activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and mass action kinetics of propionyl-CoA on fatty acid synthase result in high rates of odd chain fatty acid synthesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Overall, this work provides important new insights into the connection between BCAA catabolism and fatty acid synthesis in adipocytes and underscores the high capacity of adipocytes for metabolizing BCAA.},

  abstract = {For more than a decade, numerous studies have suggested that the c-Myc oncogenic protein is likely to broadly influence the composition of the transcriptome. However, the evidence required to support this notion was made available only recently, much to the anticipation of an eagerly awaiting field. In the past 5 years, many high-throughput screens based on microarray gene expression profiling, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by genomic array analysis, and Myc-methylase chimeric proteins have generated a wealth of information regarding Myc responsive and target genes. From these studies, the c-Myc target gene network is estimated to comprise about 15\% of all genes from flies to humans. Both genomic and functional analyses of c-Myc targets suggest that while c-Myc behaves as a global regulator of transcription, groups of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial function are over-represented in the c-Myc target gene network. c-Myc also consistently represses genes involved in cell growth arrest and cell adhesion. The overexpression of c-Myc predisposes cells to apoptosis under nutrient or growth factor deprivation conditions, although the critical sets of genes involved remain elusive. Despite tremendous advances, the downstream target genes that distinguish between physiologic and tumorigenic functions of c-Myc remain to be delineated.},

Our survey included normal human embryonic fibroblasts as well as transformed human cells of various origins: cervix carcinoma (HeLa), breast carcinoma (MCF7), Burkitt lymphoma (Daudi), and promyelocytic leukemia (HL60). All these cells revealed an extreme instability of myc mRNA (half-life, approximately equal to 10 min), suggesting that the control of myc mRNA degradation might be a general means (although not necessarily exclusive) of regulating both the level and the timing of myc gene expression. Inhibition of protein synthesis resulted in a dramatic stabilization of myc mRNA in HeLa, MCF7, and HL60 cells, suggesting that the controlling element might itself be, at least in these cells, a protein of rapid turnover. This finding opens the way to studying the mechanism of myc mRNA inactivation in these different cell types. However, protein synthesis inhibition had no effect on myc mRNA instability in other transformed (Daudi) cell lines as well as normal embryonic human fibroblasts. These different types of behavior suggest that the post-transcriptional control of myc gene expression might involve multiple factors that would be differently affected in various cell types.},

Although chromatin decompaction and transcriptional activation of target genes are associated with BRD4 binding, the mechanisms involved are unknown. We report that BRD4 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that acetylates histones H3 and H4 with a pattern distinct from those of other HATs. Both mouse and human BRD4 have intrinsic HAT activity. Importantly, BRD4 acetylates H3 K122, a residue critical for nucleosome stability, thus resulting in nucleosome eviction and chromatin decompaction. Nucleosome clearance by BRD4 occurs genome wide, including at its targets MYC, FOS and AURKB (Aurora B kinase), resulting in increased transcription. These findings suggest a model wherein BRD4 actively links chromatin structure and transcription: it mediates chromatin decompaction by acetylating and evicting nucleosomes at target genes, thereby activating transcription.},

  abstract = {For the analysis of the spectra of complex biofluids, preprocessing methods play a crucial role in rendering the subsequent data analyses more robust and accurate. Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of 1H NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.},

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1), the master regulator of the hypoxic response, enhances tumorigenesis and influences metabolism via upregulation of the glycolytic pathway and suppression of mitochondrial respiration. Together, deregulated Myc and HIF1 cooperate to lend metabolic advantages to proliferating cancer cells and contribute to the Warburg effect. Here we show that overexpression of Myc significantly stabilizes the Î± subunit of HIF1 (HIF1Î±) under normoxic conditions and enhances HIF1Î± accumulation under hypoxic conditions in cells. Posttranscriptional regulation of HIF1Î± by Myc led to the induction of HIF1Î± gene targets. Normoxic HIF1Î± protein expression was also dependent on Myc. Functionally, HIF1Î± expression was required for Myc-induced anchorage-independent growth and cell proliferation. Myc-dependent stabilization of HIF1Î± involved either disruption of binding to the VHL complex or posttranslational protein modifications. Taken together, our findings uncover a previously uncharacterized regulatory relationship between Myc and HIF1 that has important implications for cancer metabolism and development.},

The significance of these metabolic changes to ATP production remains however ill defined. Here, we integrate LC-MS-based isotope tracer studies with oxygen uptake measurements in a quantitative redox-balanced metabolic flux model of mammalian cellular metabolism. We then apply this approach to assess the impact of Ras and Akt activation and hypoxia on energy metabolism. Both oncogene activation and hypoxia induce roughly a twofold increase in glycolytic flux. Ras activation and hypoxia also strongly decrease glucose oxidation. Oxidative phosphorylation, powered substantially by glutamine-driven TCA turning, however, persists and accounts for the majority of ATP production. Consistent with this, in all cases, pharmacological inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation markedly reduces energy charge, and glutamine but not glucose removal markedly lowers oxygen uptake. Thus, glutamine-driven oxidative phosphorylation is a major means of ATP production even in hypoxic cancer cells.},

Molecules differing only in the number of isotopic atoms incorporated are referred to as mass isotopomers. The distribution of mass isotopomers of many molecules can be measured by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry after chemical derivatization. Quantification of metabolite mass isotopomer abundance resulting from biological processes necessitates correction of the measured mass isotopomer distribution of the derivatized metabolite for contributions due to naturally occurring isotopes of its elements. This correction must take into account differences in the relative natural abundance distribution of each mass isotopomer (skewing). An IBM-compatible computer program was developed which (i) calculates the natural abundance mass isotopomer distribution of unlabeled and labeled standards given the molecular formula of the derivatized molecule or fragment ion, and (ii) calculates the natural abundance mass isotopomer distribution of the singly and multiply labeled molecule or fragment via non-linear fitting to the measured mass isotopomer distribution of the unlabeled molecule or fragment. The output of this program is used to correct measured mass isotopomer distributions for contributions from natural isotope abundances and to verify measured values for theoretical consistency. Differences between predicted and measured unlabeled and 13C-labeled isotopomer distributions for hydroxamate di-t-butyl-dimethylsilyl (di-TBDMS) derivatized pyruvate were measured. The program was applied to the mass isotopomer distribution of glucose labeled from [U-13C3]glycerol and of fatty acids labeled from [U-13C6]glucose and either [2-13C2] acetate or [U-13C2]acetate. In some of these cases, the measured mass isotopomer distributions corrected by the program were different from those corrected by the classical technique. Implications of these differences including those on the calculation of glucose production due to gluconeogenesis in isolated perfused rat liver are discussed.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and fatal disease of the lung vasculature for which the molecular etiologies are unclear. Specific metabolic alterations have been identified in animal models and in PAH patients, though existing data focus mainly on abnormalities of glucose homeostasis. We hypothesized that analysis of the entire metabolome in PAH would reveal multiple other metabolic changes relevant to disease pathogenesis and possible treatment. Layered transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (hPMVEC) expressing two different disease-causing mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) confirmed previously described increases in aerobic glycolysis but also uncovered significant upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway, increases in nucleotide salvage and polyamine biosynthesis pathways, decreases in carnitine and fatty acid oxidation pathways, and major impairment of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and failure of anaplerosis. As a proof of principle, we focused on the TCA cycle, predicting that isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) activity would be altered in PAH, and then demonstrating increased IDH activity not only in cultured hPMVEC expressing mutant BMPR2 but also in the serum of PAH patients. These results suggest that widespread metabolic changes are an important part of PAH pathogenesis, and that simultaneous identification and targeting of the multiple involved pathways may be a more fruitful therapeutic approach than targeting of any one individual pathway.},

  abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: Pyridine dinucleotides, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), were discovered more than 100 years ago as necessary cofactors for fermentation in yeast extracts. Since that time, these molecules have been recognized as fundamental players in a variety of cellular processes, including energy metabolism, redox homeostasis, cellular signaling, and gene transcription, among many others. Given their critical role as mediators of cellular responses to metabolic perturbations, it is unsurprising that dysregulation of NAD and NADP metabolism has been associated with the pathobiology of many chronic human diseases. Recent Advances: A biochemistry renaissance in biomedical research, with its increasing focus on the metabolic pathobiology of human disease, has reignited interest in pyridine dinucleotides, which has led to new insights into the cell biology of NAD(P) metabolism, including its cellular pharmacokinetics, biosynthesis, subcellular localization, and regulation. This review highlights these advances to illustrate the importance of NAD(P) metabolism in the molecular pathogenesis of disease. CRITICAL ISSUES: Perturbations of NAD(H) and NADP(H) are a prominent feature of human disease; however, fundamental questions regarding the regulation of the absolute levels of these cofactors and the key determinants of their redox ratios remain. Moreover, an integrated topological model of NAD(P) biology that combines the metabolic and other roles remains elusive. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: As the complex regulatory network of NAD(P) metabolism becomes illuminated, sophisticated new approaches to manipulating these pathways in specific organs, cells, or organelles will be developed to target the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of disease, opening doors for the next generation of redox-based, metabolism-targeted therapies.

  abstract = {Oxygen sensing by hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases (HIF-PHs) is the dominant regulatory mechanism of erythropoietin (EPO) expression. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), impaired EPO expression causes anemia, which can be treated by supplementation with recombinant human EPO (rhEPO). However, treatment can result in rhEPO levels greatly exceeding the normal physiological range for endogenous EPO, and there is evidence that this contributes to hypertension in patients with CKD. Mimicking hypoxia by inhibiting HIF-PHs, thereby stabilizing HIF, is a novel treatment concept for restoring endogenous EPO production. HIF stabilization by oral administration of the HIF-PH inhibitor BAY 85-3934 (molidustat) resulted in dose-dependent production of EPO in healthy Wistar rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In repeat oral dosing of BAY 85-3934, hemoglobin levels were increased compared with animals that received vehicle, while endogenous EPO remained within the normal physiological range. BAY 85-3934 therapy was also effective in the treatment of renal anemia in rats with impaired kidney function and, unlike treatment with rhEPO, resulted in normalization of hypertensive blood pressure in a rat model of CKD. Notably, unlike treatment with the antihypertensive enalapril, the blood pressure normalization was achieved without a compensatory activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Thus, BAY 85-3934 may provide an approach to the treatment of anemia in patients with CKD, without the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects seen for patients treated with rhEPO. Clinical studies are ongoing to investigate the effects of BAY 85-3934 therapy in patients with renal anemia.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue ischemia can arise in response to numerous physiologic and pathologic conditions. The cellular response to decreased perfusion, most notably a decrease in glucose and oxygen, is important for cellular survival. In response to oxygen deprivation or hypoxia, one of the key response elements is hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and a key protein induced by hypoxia is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Under hypoxia, we and others have reported an increase in the half-life of VEGF and other hypoxia related mRNAs including MYC and CYR61; however, the mediator of this response has yet to be identified. For this study, we sought to determine if HIF-mediated transcriptional activity is involved in the mRNA stabilization induced by hypoxia. METHODS: HEK293T or C6 cells were cultured in either normoxic or hypoxic (1\% oxygen) conditions in the presence of 1~g/L glucose for all experiments. Pharmacological treatments were used to mimic hypoxia (desferroxamine, dimethyloxaloglutamate, CoCl2), inhibit mitochondrial respiration (rotenone, myxothiazol), scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS; ebselen), or generate mitochondrial ROS (antimycin A). siRNAs were used to knock down components of the HIF transcriptional apparatus. mRNA half-life was determined via actinomycin D decay and real time PCR and western blotting was used to determine mRNA and protein levels respectively. RESULTS: Treatment of HEK293T or C6 cells with hypoxic mimetics, desferroxamine, dimethyloxaloglutamate, or CoCl2 showed similar induction of HIF compared to hypoxia treatment, however, in contrast to hypoxia, the mimetics caused no significant increase in VEGF, MYC or CYR61 mRNA half-life. Knockdown of HIF-alpha or ARNT via siRNA also had no effect on hypoxic mRNA stabilization. Interestingly, treatment of HEK293T cells with the mitochondrial inhibitors rotenone and myxothiazol, or the glutathione peroxidase mimetic ebselen did prevent the hypoxic stabilization of VEGF, MYC, and CYR61, suggesting a role for mtROS in the process. Additionally, treatment with antimycin A, which has been shown to generate mtROS, was able to drive the normoxic stabilization of these mRNAs. CONCLUSION: Overall these data suggest that hypoxic mRNA stabilization is independent of HIF transcriptional activity but requires mtROS.},

  abstract = {Post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA during oxygen deprivation, or hypoxia, can affect the survivability of cells. Hypoxia has been shown to increase stability of a subset of ischemia-related mRNAs, including VEGF. RNA binding proteins and miRNAs have been identified as important for post-transcriptional regulation of individual mRNAs, but corresponding mechanisms that regulate global stability are not well understood. Recently, mRNA modification by N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation processes including mRNA stability and promotion of translation, but the role of m6A in the hypoxia response is unknown. In this study, we investigate the effect of hypoxia on RNA modifications including m6A. Our results show hypoxia increases m6A content of poly(A)+ messenger RNA (mRNA), but not in total or ribosomal RNA in HEK293T cells. Using m6A mRNA immunoprecipitation, we identify specific hypoxia-modified mRNAs, including glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) and c-Myc, which show increased m6A levels under hypoxic conditions. Many of these mRNAs also exhibit increased stability, which was blocked by knockdown of m6A-specific methyltransferases METTL3/14. However, the increase in mRNA stability did not correlate with a change in translational efficiency or the steady-state amount of their proteins. Knockdown of METTL3/14 did reveal that m6A is involved in recovery of translational efficiency after hypoxic stress. Therefore, our results suggest that an increase in m6A mRNA during hypoxic exposure leads to post-transcriptional stabilization of specific mRNAs and contributes to the recovery of translational efficiency after hypoxic stress.},

To gain insights into the role of HIF and the molecular mechanisms underlying RC, we took advantage of a panel of disease-associated VHL mutants and showed that HIF expression is necessary and sufficient for the induction of RC in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. HIF expression drastically reduced intracellular citrate levels. Feeding VHL-deficient RCC cells with acetate or citrate or knocking down PDK-1 and ACLY restored citrate levels and suppressed RC. These data suggest that HIF-induced low intracellular citrate levels promote the reductive flux by mass action to maintain lipogenesis. Using [(1-13)C]glutamine, we demonstrated in vivo RC activity in VHL-deficient tumors growing as xenografts in mice. Lastly, HIF rendered VHL-deficient cells sensitive to glutamine deprivation in vitro, and systemic administration of glutaminase inhibitors suppressed the growth of RCC cells as mice xenografts.},

  abstract = {The prediction of transcription factor (TF) activities from the gene expression of their targets (i.e., TF regulon) is becoming a widely used approach to characterize the functional status of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and data sets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are (1) manually curated repositories, (2) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (3) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (4) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression data sets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations and, thereby, downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark data sets. We assembled a collection of TF-target interactions for 1541 human TFs and evaluated how different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities, or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions derived through these strategies, with confidence scores, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.},

However, the limiting metabolites for proliferation under hypoxia and in tumours are unknown. Here, we assessed proliferation of a collection of cancer cells following inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), a major metabolic pathway requiring molecular oxygen5. Sensitivity to ETC inhibition varied across cell lines, and subsequent metabolomic analysis uncovered aspartate availability as a major determinant of sensitivity. Cell lines least sensitive to ETC inhibition maintain aspartate levels by importing it through an aspartate/glutamate transporter, SLC1A3. Genetic or pharmacologic modulation of SLC1A3 activity markedly altered cancer cell sensitivity to ETC inhibitors. Interestingly, aspartate levels also decrease under low oxygen, and increasing aspartate import by SLC1A3 provides a competitive advantage to cancer cells at low oxygen levels and in tumour xenografts. Finally, aspartate levels in primary human tumours negatively correlate with the expression of hypoxia markers, suggesting that tumour hypoxia is sufficient to inhibit ETC and, consequently, aspartate synthesis in vivo. Therefore, aspartate may be a limiting metabolite for tumour growth, and aspartate availability could be targeted for cancer therapy.},

MYC promotes the cell cycle by not only activating or inducing cyclins and CDKs but also through the downregulation or the impairment of the activity of a set of proteins that act as cell-cycle brakes. This review is focused on the role of MYC as a cell-cycle brake releaser i.e., how MYC stimulates the cell cycle mainly through the functional inactivation of cell cycle inhibitors. MYC antagonizes the activities and/or the expression levels of p15, ARF, p21, and p27. The mechanism involved differs for each protein. p15 (encoded by CDKN2B) and p21 (CDKN1A) are repressed by MYC at the transcriptional level. In contrast, MYC activates ARF, which contributes to the apoptosis induced by high MYC levels. At least in some cells types, MYC inhibits the transcription of the p27 gene (CDKN1B) but also enhances p27's degradation through the upregulation of components of ubiquitin ligases complexes. The effect of MYC on cell-cycle brakes also opens the possibility of antitumoral therapies based on synthetic lethal interactions involving MYC and CDKs, for which a series of inhibitors are being developed and tested in clinical trials.},

Although transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes by the hypoxia-induced transcription factor (HIF-1) has been established, the mechanism for the hypoxia-induced G1 arrest is not known. By using genetically defined primary wild-type murine embryo fibroblasts and those nullizygous for regulators of the G1/S checkpoint, we observed that the retinoblastoma protein is essential for the G1/S hypoxia-induced checkpoint, whereas p53 and p21 are not required. In addition, we found that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 is induced by hypoxia, thereby inhibiting CDK2 activity and forestalling S phase entry through retinoblastoma protein hypophosphorylation. Reduction or absence of p27 abrogated the hypoxia-induced G1 checkpoint, suggesting that it is a key regulator of G1/S transition in hypoxic cells. Intriguingly, hypoxic induction of p27 appears to be transcriptional and through an HIF-1-independent region of its proximal promoter. This demonstration of the molecular mechanism of hypoxia-induced G1/S regulation provides insight into a fundamental response of mammalian cells to low oxygen tension.},

Finally, HIF-2alpha augments c-Myc transformation of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Enhanced c-Myc activity likely contributes to HIF-2alpha-mediated neoplastic progression following loss of the VHL tumor suppressor and influences the behavior of hypoxic tumor cells.},

In this study, we performed (13)C metabolic flux analysis on a panel of isogenic cell lines containing heterozygous IDH1/2 mutations. We observed that under hypoxic conditions, IDH1-mutant cells exhibited increased oxidative tricarboxylic acid metabolism along with decreased reductive glutamine metabolism, but not IDH2-mutant cells. However, selective inhibition of mutant IDH1 enzyme function could not reverse the defect in reductive carboxylation activity. Furthermore, this metabolic reprogramming increased the sensitivity of IDH1-mutant cells to hypoxia or electron transport chain inhibition in vitro. Lastly, IDH1-mutant cells also grew poorly as subcutaneous xenografts within a hypoxic in vivo microenvironment. Together, our results suggest therapeutic opportunities to exploit the metabolic vulnerabilities specific to IDH1 mutation.},

Thr-58 is a major phosphorylation site in c-Myc and is a mutational hotspot in Burkitt's and other aggressive human lymphomas, indicating that Thr-58 phosphorylation restricts the oncogenic potential of c-Myc. Mutation of Thr-58 is also associated with increased c-Myc protein stability. Here we show that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity with lithium increases c-Myc stability and inhibits phosphorylation of c-Myc specifically at Thr-58 in vivo. Conversely, overexpression of GSK-3 alpha or GSK-3 beta enhances Thr-58 phosphorylation and ubiquitination of c-Myc. Together, these observations suggest that phosphorylation of Thr-58 mediated by GSK-3 facilitates c-Myc rapid proteolysis by the ubiquitin pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GSK-3 binds c-Myc in vivo and in vitro and that GSK-3 colocalizes with c-Myc in the nucleus, strongly arguing that GSK-3 is the c-Myc Thr-58 kinase. We found that c-MycS, which lacks the N-terminal 100 amino acids of c-Myc, is unable to bind GSK-3; however, mutation of Ser-62, the priming phosphorylation site necessary for Thr-58 phosphorylation, does not disrupt GSK-3 binding. Finally, we show that Thr-58 phosphorylation alters the subnuclear localization of c-Myc, enhancing its localization to discrete nuclear bodies together with GSK-3.},

Its pharmacological precursor, ethyl pyruvate, has shown anti-inflammatory/anti-tissue injury effects in various animal models of disease, but failed in a multicenter clinical trial. Since rodents, but not humans, can convert ethyl pyruvate to pyruvate in blood plasma, this additional source of extracellular pyruvate may have contributed to the discrepancy between the species. To examine this possibility, we investigated the kinetics of the reaction under biological conditions and determined the second order rate constant k as 2.360\,Â±\,0.198\,M-1\,s-1. We then calculated the time required for H2O2 elimination by pyruvate. The results show that, with an average intracellular concentration of pyruvate (150\,ÂµM), elimination of 95\% H2O2 at normal to pathological concentrations (0.01-50\,ÂµM) requires 141-185\,min (2.4-3\,hour). With 1,000\,ÂµM pyruvate, a concentration that can only exist extracellularly or in cell culture media, 95\% elimination of H2O2 at 5-200\,ÂµM requires 21-25\,min. We conclude that intracellular pyruvate, or other Î±-ketoacids, whose endogenous concentration is controlled by metabolism, have little role in H2O2 clearance. An increased extracellular concentration of pyruvate, however, does have remarkable peroxide scavenging effects, considering minimal peroxidase activity in this space.},

Because of similarities in the relaxation of BCA to hypoxia (Po(2) = 8-10 Torr) and inhibitors of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) including 6-aminonicotinamide and epiandrosterone, we measured NADPH and NADP and found that hypoxia caused NADPH oxidation (decreased NADPH/NADP). The relaxation to hypoxia was similar to previously reported properties of relaxation to PPP inhibitors in that both responses were associated with glutathione oxidation and depressed intracellular calcium release and calcium influx-mediated contractile responses. Inhibitors of potassium channels had minimal effects on these relaxation responses. Relaxation to hypoxia and PPP inhibitors were attenuated by a thiol reductant (3 mM dithiothreitol) and by eliciting contraction with an activator of protein kinase C (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate). In the presence of contraction to U-46619, relaxation to hypoxia and PPP inhibitors were attenuated by the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase pump inhibitor 200 microM cyclopiazonic acid and by 10 mM pyruvate. Hypoxia decreased BCA levels of glucose-6-phosphate but not ATP. Pyruvate prevented the hypoxia-elicited decrease in glucose-6-phosphate and glutathione oxidation, and it increased NADPH levels under hypoxia to levels observed under normoxia. Thus hypoxia causes a metabolic stress on the PPP that promotes BCA relaxation through processes controlled by lowering the levels of cytosolic NADPH.},

One of the key cell-autonomous effects of hypoxia is as a modulator of cell proliferation. For most cell types, hypoxia induces decreased cell proliferation, since an increased number of cells, with a consequent increase in O2 demand, would only exacerbate hypoxic stress. However, certain cell populations maintain cell proliferation in the face of hypoxia. This is a common pathological hallmark of cancers, but can also serve a physiological function, as in the maintenance of stem cell populations that reside in a hypoxic niche. This review will discuss major molecular mechanisms by which hypoxia regulates cell proliferation in different cell populations, with a particular focus on the role of hypoxia-inducible factors.},

  abstract = {Mammalian tissues are fuelled by circulating nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and various intermediary metabolites. Under aerobic conditions, glucose is generally assumed to be burned fully by tissues via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) to carbon dioxide. Alternatively, glucose can be catabolized anaerobically via glycolysis to lactate, which is itself also a potential nutrient for tissues and tumours. The quantitative relevance of circulating lactate or other metabolic intermediates as fuels remains unclear. Here we systematically examine the fluxes of circulating metabolites in mice, and find that lactate can be a primary source of carbon for the TCA cycle and thus of energy. Intravenous infusions of 13C-labelled nutrients reveal that, on a molar basis, the circulatory turnover flux of lactate is the highest of all metabolites and exceeds that of glucose by 1.1-fold in fed mice and 2.5-fold in fasting mice; lactate is made primarily from glucose but also from other sources. In both fed and fasted mice, 13C-lactate extensively labels TCA cycle intermediates in all tissues. Quantitative analysis reveals that during the fasted state, the contribution of glucose to tissue TCA metabolism is primarily indirect (via circulating lactate) in all tissues except the brain. In genetically engineered lung and pancreatic cancer tumours in fasted mice, the contribution of circulating lactate to TCA cycle intermediates exceeds that of glucose, with glutamine making a larger contribution than lactate in pancreatic cancer. Thus, glycolysis and the TCA cycle are uncoupled at the level of lactate, which is a primary circulating TCA substrate in most tissues and tumours.},

These nutrients originate from diet and internal stores, and can undergo various interconversions before their eventual use as tissue fuel. Here we develop isotope tracing, mass spectrometry, and mathematical analysis methods to determine the direct sources of circulating nutrients, their interconversion rates, and eventual tissue-specific contributions to TCA cycle metabolism. Experiments with fifteen nutrient tracers enabled extensive accounting for both circulatory metabolic cycles and tissue TCA inputs, across fed and fasted mice on either high-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet. We find that a majority of circulating carbon flux is carried by two major cycles: glucose-lactate and triglyceride-glycerol-fatty acid. Futile cycling through these pathways is prominent when dietary content of the associated nutrients is low, rendering internal metabolic activity robust to food choice. The presented in~vivo flux quantification methods are broadly applicable to different physiological and disease states.},

  abstract = {MYC is a pleiotropic transcription factor that controls a number of fundamental cellular processes required for the proliferation and survival of normal and malignant cells, including the cell cycle. MYC interacts with several central cell cycle regulators that control the balance between cell cycle progression and temporary or permanent cell cycle arrest (cellular senescence). Among these are the cyclin E/A/cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) complexes, the CDK inhibitor p27KIP1 (p27) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase component S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), which control each other by forming a triangular network. MYC is engaged in bidirectional crosstalk with each of these players; while MYC regulates their expression and/or activity, these factors in turn modulate MYC through protein interactions and post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, impacting on MYC's transcriptional output on genes involved in cell cycle progression and senescence. Here we elaborate on these network interactions with MYC and their impact on transcription, cell cycle, replication and stress signaling, and on the role of other players interconnected to this network, such as CDK1, the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), the F-box proteins FBXW7 and FBXO28, the RAS oncoprotein and the ubiquitin/proteasome system.

Human 2OGXs, particularly those regulating transcription, are current therapeutic targets for anemia and cancer.

We describe protocols for performing the necessary isotope labeling experiments, for quenching and extraction of intracellular metabolites, for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of metabolite labeling, and for computational flux estimation using INST-MFA. By combining several recently developed experimental and computational techniques, INST-MFA provides an important new platform for mapping carbon fluxes that is especially applicable to animal cell cultures, autotrophic organisms, industrial bioprocesses, high-throughput experiments, and other systems that are not amenable to steady-state (13)C MFA experiments.},

Overcoming the addiction to ECM-induced signals is required for anchorage-independent growth, a property of most malignant cells. Detachment from ECM is associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) owing to altered glucose metabolism. Here we identify an unconventional pathway that supports redox homeostasis and growth during adaptation to anchorage independence. We observed that detachment from monolayer culture and growth as anchorage-independent tumour spheroids was accompanied by changes in both glucose and glutamine metabolism. Specifically, oxidation of both nutrients was suppressed in spheroids, whereas reductive formation of citrate from glutamine was enhanced. Reductive glutamine metabolism was highly dependent on cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), because the activity was suppressed in cells homozygous null for IDH1 or treated with an IDH1 inhibitor. This activity occurred in absence of hypoxia, a well-known inducer of reductive metabolism. Rather, IDH1 mitigated mitochondrial ROS in spheroids, and suppressing IDH1 reduced spheroid growth through a mechanism requiring mitochondrial ROS. Isotope tracing revealed that in spheroids, isocitrate/citrate produced reductively in the cytosol could enter the mitochondria and participate in oxidative metabolism, including oxidation by IDH2. This generates NADPH in the mitochondria, enabling cells to mitigate mitochondrial ROS and maximize growth. Neither IDH1 nor IDH2 was necessary for monolayer growth, but deleting either one enhanced mitochondrial ROS and reduced spheroid size, as did deletion of the mitochondrial citrate transporter protein. Together, the data indicate that adaptation to anchorage independence requires a fundamental change in citrate metabolism, initiated by IDH1-dependent reductive carboxylation and culminating in suppression of mitochondrial ROS.},

Here we identify a key role for serine and glycine metabolism in the survival of brain cancer cells within the ischaemic zones of gliomas. In human glioblastoma multiforme, mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2) and glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) are highly expressed in the pseudopalisading cells that surround necrotic foci. We find that SHMT2 activity limits that of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) and reduces oxygen consumption, eliciting a metabolic state that confers a profound survival advantage to cells in poorly vascularized tumour regions. GLDC inhibition impairs cells with high SHMT2 levels as the excess glycine not metabolized by GLDC can be converted to the toxic molecules aminoacetone and methylglyoxal. Thus, SHMT2 is required for cancer cells to adapt to the tumour environment, but also renders these cells sensitive to glycine cleavage system inhibition.},

  abstract = {Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is an ubiquitously used tool for evaluating pathway enrichment in transcriptional data. Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked GSEA performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure. Here we present FGSEA (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low GSEA P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for GSEA P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that FGSEA is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10â100 with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate FGSEA on a collection of 605 datasets and show that FGSEA recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations. FGSEA is open source and available as an R package in Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea/) and on GitHub (https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea/).},

  abstract = {Hypoxia induces angiogenesis and glycolysis for cell growth and survival, and also leads to growth arrest and apoptosis. HIF-1alpha, a basic helix-loop-helix PAS transcription factor, acts as a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis by upregulating various genes under low oxygen tension. Although genetic studies have indicated the requirement of HIF-1alpha for hypoxia-induced growth arrest and activation of p21(cip1), a key cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor controlling cell cycle checkpoint, the mechanism underlying p21(cip1) activation has been elusive. Here we demonstrate that HIF-1alpha, even in the absence of hypoxic signal, induces cell cycle arrest by functionally counteracting Myc, thereby derepressing p21(cip1). The HIF-1alpha antagonism is mediated by displacing Myc binding from p21(cip1) promoter. Neither HIF-1alpha transcriptional activity nor its DNA binding is essential for cell cycle arrest, indicating a divergent role for HIF-1alpha. In keeping with its antagonism of Myc, HIF-1alpha also downregulates Myc-activated genes such as hTERT and BRCA1. Hence, we propose that Myc is an integral part of a novel HIF-1alpha pathway, which regulates a distinct group of Myc target genes in response to hypoxia.},

The transcription factor HIF-1alpha is crucial for the cellular response to hypoxia and is frequently overexpressed in human cancers, resulting in the activation of genes essential for cell survival. Here, we demonstrate that HIF-1alpha is responsible for genetic instability at the nucleotide level by inhibiting MSH2 and MSH6, thereby decreasing levels of the MSH2-MSH6 complex, MutSalpha, which recognizes base mismatches. HIF-1alpha displaces the transcriptional activator Myc from Sp1 binding to repress MutSalpha expression in a p53-dependent manner; Sp1 serves as a molecular switch by recruiting HIF-1alpha to the gene promoter under hypoxia. Furthermore, in human sporadic colon cancers, HIF-1alpha overexpression is statistically associated with the loss of MSH2 expression, especially when p53 is immunochemically undetectable. These findings indicate that the regulation of DNA repair is an integral part of the hypoxic response, providing molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced genetic instability.},

Using [U-(13)C]-glucose as the tracer, both glucose consumption and lactate production were increased by MYC expression and hypoxia. Using [U-(13)C,(15)N]-glutamine as the tracer, glutamine import and metabolism through the TCA cycle persisted under hypoxia, and glutamine contributed significantly to citrate carbons. Under glucose deprivation, glutamine-derived fumarate, malate, and citrate were significantly increased. Their (13)C-labeling patterns demonstrate an alternative energy-generating glutaminolysis pathway involving a glucose-independent TCA cycle. The essential role of glutamine metabolism in cell survival and proliferation under hypoxia and glucose deficiency makes them susceptible to the glutaminase inhibitor BPTES and hence could be targeted for cancer therapy.},

Applied to study reductive glutamine metabolism in cancer cells, shown to mediate fatty acid biosynthesis under hypoxia and defective mitochondria, we find a previously unappreciated role of reductive IDH1 as the sole net contributor of carbons to fatty acid biosynthesis under standard normoxic conditions in HeLa cells. In murine cells with defective SDH, we find that reductive biosynthesis of citrate in mitochondria is followed by a reversed CS activity, suggesting a new route for supporting pyrimidine biosynthesis. We expect this spatial-fluxomics approach to be a highly useful tool for elucidating the role of metabolic dysfunction in human disease.},

  abstract = {Molecular oxygen (O2) sustains intracellular bioenergetics and is consumed by numerous biochemical reactions, making it essential for most species on Earth. Accordingly, decreased oxygen concentration (hypoxia) is a major stressor that generally subverts life of aerobic species and is a prominent feature of pathological states encountered in bacterial infection, inflammation, wounds, cardiovascular defects and cancer. Therefore, key adaptive mechanisms to cope with hypoxia have evolved in mammals. Systemically, these adaptations include increased ventilation, cardiac output, blood vessel growth and circulating red blood cell numbers. On a cellular level, ATP-consuming reactions are suppressed, and metabolism is altered until oxygen homeostasis is restored. A critical question is how mammalian cells sense oxygen levels to coordinate diverse biological outputs during hypoxia. The best-studied mechanism of response to hypoxia involves hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), which are stabilized by low oxygen availability and control the expression of a multitude of genes, including those involved in cell survival, angiogenesis, glycolysis and invasion/metastasis. Importantly, changes in oxygen can also be sensed via other stress pathways as well as changes in metabolite levels and the generation of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria. Collectively, this leads to cellular adaptations of protein synthesis, energy metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, lipid and carbon metabolism as well as nutrient acquisition. These mechanisms are integral inputs into fine-tuning the responses to hypoxic stress.},

Previous experiments identified a CRD-binding protein (CRD-BP) that appears to protect the CRD from endonuclease cleavage. However, it was unclear why a CRD-BP is required to protect a well-translated mRNA whose coding region is covered with ribosomes. We hypothesized that translational pausing in the CRD generates a ribosome-deficient region downstream of the pause site, and this region is exposed to endonuclease attack unless it is shielded by the CRD-BP. Transfection and cell-free translation experiments reported here support this hypothesis. Ribosome pausing occurs within the c-myc CRD in tRNA-depleted reticulocyte translation reactions. The pause sites map to a rare arginine (CGA) codon and to an adjacent threonine (ACA) codon. Changing these codons to more common codons increases translational efficiency in vitro and increases mRNA abundance in transfected cells. These data suggest that c-myc mRNA is rapidly degraded unless it is (i) translated without pausing or (ii) protected by the CRD-BP when pausing occurs. Additional mapping experiments suggest that the CRD is bipartite, with several upstream translation pause sites and a downstream endonuclease cleavage site.},

To understand the roles of arginase isoforms in EC arginine metabolism, bovine coronary venular EC were stably transfected with the Escherichia coli lacZ gene (lacZ-EC, control), rat arginase I cDNA (AI-EC), or mouse arginase II cDNA (AII-EC). Western blots and enzymatic assays confirmed high-level expression of arginase I in the cytosol of AI-EC and of arginase II in mitochondria of AII-EC. For determining arginine catabolism, EC were cultured for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.4 mM L-arginine plus [1-(14)C]arginine. Urea formation, which accounted for nearly all arginine consumption by these cells, was enhanced by 616 and 157\% in AI-EC and AII-EC, respectively, compared with lacZ-EC. Arginine uptake was 31-33\% greater in AI-EC and AII-EC than in lacZ-EC. Intracellular arginine content was 25 and 11\% lower in AI-EC and AII-EC, respectively, compared with lacZ-EC. Basal nitric oxide (NO) production was reduced by 60\% in AI-EC and by 47\% in AII-EC. Glutamate and proline production from arginine increased by 164 and 928\% in AI-EC and by 79 and 295\% in AII-EC, respectively, compared with lacZ-EC. Intracellular content of putrescine and spermidine was increased by 275 and 53\% in AI-EC and by 158 and 43\% in AII-EC, respectively, compared with lacZ-EC. Our results indicate that arginase expression can modulate NO synthesis in bovine venular EC and that basal levels of arginase I and II are limiting for endothelial syntheses of polyamines, proline, and glutamate and may have important implications for wound healing, angiogenesis, and cardiovascular function.},

Conversely, compared to wild-type Myc fibroblasts, Myc null rat fibroblasts have diminished mitochondrial mass and decreased number of normal mitochondria. Reconstitution of Myc expression in Myc null fibroblasts partially restored mitochondrial mass and function and normal-appearing mitochondria. Concordantly, we also observed in primary hepatocytes that acute deletion of floxed murine Myc by Cre recombinase resulted in diminished mitochondrial mass in primary hepatocytes. Our microarray analysis of genes responsive to Myc in human P493-6 B lymphocytes supports a role for Myc in mitochondrial biogenesis, since genes involved in mitochondrial structure and function are overrepresented among the Myc-induced genes. In addition to the known direct binding of Myc to many genes involved in mitochondrial structure and function, we found that Myc binds the TFAM gene, which encodes a key transcriptional regulator and mitochondrial DNA replication factor, both in P493-6 lymphocytes with high ectopic MYC expression and in serum-stimulated primary human 2091 fibroblasts with induced endogenous MYC. These observations support a pivotal role for Myc in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis.},

It is overexpressed or deregulated in human cancers of diverse origins and plays a key role in the development of cancers. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), a central regulator for cells to adapt to low cellular oxygen levels, is also often overexpressed and activated in many human cancers. HIF mediates the primary transcriptional response of a wide range of genes in response to hypoxia. Earlier studies focused on the inhibition of MYC by HIF during hypoxia, when MYC is expressed at physiological level, to help cells survive under low oxygen conditions. Emerging evidence suggests that MYC and HIF also cooperate to promote cancer cell growth and progression. This review will summarize the current understanding of the complex molecular interplay between MYC and HIF.},

The resulting read counts can be input directly into a wide range of downstream statistical analyses using other Bioconductor packages. Using SEQC data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to TopHat2, STAR and HTSeq as well as to counting functions in the Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We consider the performance of these tools on the combined quantification task starting from raw sequence reads through to summary counts, and in particular evaluate the performance of different combinations of alignment and counting algorithms.

Each hallmark in this collection consists of a "refined" gene set, derived from multiple "founder" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect and underlying mechanism of angiotensin II (Ang II) on collagen synthesis in hypoxic human lung fibroblast (HLF) cells. The HLF-1 cell line was used for in vitro studies. Angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) expression levels in human lung fibroblasts were analysed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after hypoxic treatment. Additionally, the collagen type I (Col-I), AT1R and nuclear factor ÎºappaB (NF-ÎºB) protein expression levels were detected using Western blot analysis, and NF-ÎºB nuclear translocation was measured using immunofluorescence localization analysis. Ang II levels in HLF-1 cells were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that hypoxia increased Col-I mRNA and protein expression in HLF-1 cells, and this effect could be inhibited by an AT1R or AT2R inhibitor. The levels of NF-ÎºB, RAS components and Ang II production in HLF-1 cells were significantly increased after the hypoxia exposure. Hypoxia or Ang II increased NF-ÎºB-p50 protein expression in HLF-1 cells, and the special effect could be inhibited by telmisartan (TST), an AT1R inhibitor, and partially inhibited by PD123319, an AT2R inhibitor. Importantly, hypoxia-induced NF-ÎºB nuclear translocation could be nearly completely inhibited by an AT1R or AT2R inhibitor. Furthermore pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a NF-ÎºB blocker, abolished the expression of hypoxia-induced AT1R and Col-I in HLF-1 cells. Our results indicate that Ang II-mediated NF-ÎºB signalling via ATR is involved in hypoxia-induced collagen synthesis in human lung fibroblasts.},

In growing cells, it is efficient to produce NADPH via the oxPPP and folate metabolism, which also make nucleotide precursors. In nonproliferating adipocytes, a metabolic cycle involving malic enzyme holds the potential to make both NADPH and two-carbon units for fat synthesis. Recently developed deuterium ((2)H) tracer methods have enabled direct measurement of NADPH production by the oxPPP and folate metabolism. Here we enable tracking of NADPH production by malic enzyme with [2,2,3,3-(2)H]dimethyl-succinate and [4-(2)H]glucose. Using these tracers, we show that most NADPH in differentiating 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes is made by malic enzyme. The associated metabolic cycle is disrupted by hypoxia, which switches the main adipocyte NADPH source to the oxPPP. Thus, (2)H-labeled tracers enable dissection of NADPH production routes across cell types and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {The N-terminal domain of the c-Myc protein has been reported to be critical for both the transactivation and biological functions of the c-Myc proteins. Through detailed phosphopeptide mapping analyses, we demonstrate that there is a cluster of four regulated and complex phosphorylation events on the N-terminal domain of Myc proteins, including Thr-58, Ser-62, and Ser-71. An apparent enhancement of Ser-62 phosphorylation occurs on v-Myc proteins having a mutation at Thr-58 which has previously been correlated with increased transforming ability. In contrast, phosphorylation of Thr-58 in cells is dependent on a prior phosphorylation of Ser-62. Hierarchical phosphorylation of c-Myc is also observed in vitro with a specific glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha, unlike the promiscuous phosphorylation observed with other glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha and 3 beta preparations. Although both p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and cdc2 kinase specifically phosphorylate Ser-62 in vitro and cellular phosphorylation of Thr-58/Ser-62 is stimulated by mitogens, other in vivo experiments do not support a role for these kinases in the phosphorylation of Myc proteins. Unexpectedly, both the Thr-58 and Ser-62 phosphorylation events, but not other N-terminal phosphorylation events, can occur in the cytoplasm, suggesting that translocation of the c-Myc proteins to the nucleus is not required for phosphorylation at these sites. In addition, there appears to be an unusual block to the phosphorylation of Ser-62 during mitosis. Finally, although the enhanced transforming properties of Myc proteins correlates with the loss of phosphorylation at Thr-58 and an enhancement of Ser-62 phosphorylation, these phosphorylation events do not alter the ability of c-Myc to transactivate through the CACGTG Myc/Max binding site.},

They also serve as signaling molecules, for example, being able to activate mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). This has implication for macronutrient metabolism. However, elevated circulating levels of BCAAs and of their ketoacids as well as impaired catabolism of these amino acids (AAs) are implicated in the development of insulin resistance and its sequelae, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and of some cancers, although other studies indicate supplements of these AAs may help in the management of some chronic diseases. Here, we first reviewed the catabolism of these AAs especially in skeletal muscle as this tissue contributes the most to whole body disposal of the BCAA. We then reviewed emerging mechanisms of control of enzymes involved in regulating BCAA catabolism. Such mechanisms include regulation of their abundance by microRNA and by post translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. We also reviewed implications of impaired metabolism of BCAA for muscle and whole-body metabolism. We comment on outstanding questions in the regulation of catabolism of these AAs, including regulation of the abundance and post-transcriptional/post-translational modification of enzymes that regulate BCAA catabolism, as well the impact of circadian rhythm, age and mTORC1 on these enzymes. Answers to such questions may facilitate emergence of treatment/management options that can help patients suffering from chronic diseases linked to impaired metabolism of the BCAAs.},

ADO catalyzes the conversion of amino-terminal cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid and is related to the plant cysteine oxidases that mediate responses to hypoxia by an identical posttranslational modification. We show in human cells that ADO regulates RGS4/5 (regulator of G protein signaling) N-degron substrates, modulates G protein-coupled calcium ion signals and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, and that its activity extends to other N-cysteine proteins including the angiogenic cytokine interleukin-32.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF1Î±) can suppress tumor cell proliferation. Here, we discovered that HIF1Î± acts as a direct repressor of aspartate biosynthesis involving the suppression of several key aspartate-producing proteins, including cytosolic glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase-1 (GOT1) and mitochondrial GOT2. Accordingly, HIF1Î± suppresses aspartate production from both glutamine oxidation as well as the glutamine reductive pathway. Strikingly, the addition of aspartate to the culture medium is sufficient to relieve HIF1Î±-dependent repression of tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, these key aspartate-producing players are specifically repressed in VHL-deficient human renal carcinomas, a paradigmatic tumor type in which HIF1Î± acts as a tumor suppressor, highlighting the in~vivo relevance of these findings. In conclusion, we show that HIF1Î± inhibits cytosolic and mitochondrial aspartate biosynthesis and that this mechanism is the molecular basis for HIF1Î± tumor suppressor activity.},

In the conventional view of mammalian cell metabolism, AcCoA is primarily generated from glucose-derived pyruvate through the citrate shuttle and ATP citrate lyase in the cytosol. However, proliferating cells that exhibit aerobic glycolysis and those exposed to hypoxia convert glucose to lactate at near-stoichiometric levels, directing glucose carbon away from the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty-acid synthesis. Although glutamine is consumed at levels exceeding that required for nitrogen biosynthesis, the regulation and use of glutamine metabolism in hypoxic cells is not well understood. Here we show that human cells use reductive metabolism of Î±-ketoglutarate to synthesize AcCoA for lipid synthesis. This isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1)-dependent pathway is active in most cell lines under normal culture conditions, but cells grown under hypoxia rely almost exclusively on the reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived Î±-ketoglutarate for de novo lipogenesis. Furthermore, renal cell lines deficient in the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein preferentially use reductive glutamine metabolism for lipid biosynthesis even at normal oxygen levels. These results identify a critical role for oxygen in regulating carbon use to produce AcCoA and support lipid synthesis in mammalian cells.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypoxia induces the proliferation of lung fibroblasts in vivo and in vitro. However, the subcellular interactions between hypoxia and expression of tumor suppressor p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 remain unclear. METHODS: Normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) were cultured in a hypoxic chamber or exposed to desferroxamine (DFX). DNA synthesis was measured using bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and expression of p53, p21 and p27 was measured using real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: DNA synthesis was increased by moderate hypoxia (2\% oxygen) but was decreased by severe hypoxia (0.1\% oxygen) and DFX. Moderate hypoxia decreased p21 synthesis without affecting p53 synthesis, whereas severe hypoxia and DFX increased synthesis of both p21 and p53. p27 protein expression was decreased by severe hypoxia and DFX. Gene silencing of p21 and p27 promoted DNA synthesis at ambient oxygen concentrations. p21 and p53 gene silencing lessened the decrease in DNA synthesis due to severe hypoxia or DFX exposure. p21 gene silencing prevented increased DNA synthesis in moderate hypoxia. p27 protein expression was significantly increased by p53 gene silencing, and was decreased by wild-type p53 gene transfection. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that in NHLF, severe hypoxia leads to cell cycle arrest via the p53-p21 pathway, but that moderate hypoxia enhances cell proliferation via the p21 pathway in a p53-independent manner. In addition, our results suggest that p27 may be involved in compensating for p53 in cultured NHLF proliferation.},

We applied two different methods of regression and error analysis to estimate specific metabolic rates from time-course measurements obtained in exponentially growing cell cultures. Using simulated data sets to compute specific rates of growth, glucose uptake, and lactate excretion, we found that Gaussian error propagation from prime variables to the final calculated rates was the most accurate method for estimating parameter uncertainty. We incorporated this method into a MATLAB-based software package called Extracellular Time-Course Analysis (ETA), which automates the analysis workflow required to (i) compute cell specific metabolic rates and their uncertainties; (ii) test the goodness-of-fit of the experimental data to the regression model; and (iii) rapidly compare the results across multiple experiments. ETA was used to estimate the uptake or excretion rate of glucose, lactate, and 18 different amino acids in a B-cell model of c-Myc-driven cancer. We found that P493-6 cells with High Myc expression increased their specific uptake of glutamine, arginine, serine, lysine, and branched-chain amino acids by two- to threefold in comparison to low Myc cells, but exhibited only modest increases in glucose uptake and lactate excretion. By making the ETA software package freely available to the scientific community, we expect that it will become an important tool for rigorous estimation of specific rates required for metabolic flux analysis and other quantitative metabolic studies.},

Here, we have identified L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L2HG) as a universal adaptive determinant of the hypoxia response. L2HG is a metabolite of unknown function produced by the reduction of mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate by malate dehydrogenase. L2HG accumulates in response to increases in 2-oxoglutarate, which occur as a result of tricarboxylic acid cycle dysfunction and increased mitochondrial reducing potential. These changes are closely coupled to cellular redox homeostasis, as increased cellular L2HG inhibits electron transport and glycolysis to offset the adverse consequences of mitochondrial reductive stress induced by hypoxia. Thus, L2HG couples mitochondrial and cytoplasmic energy metabolism in a model of cellular redox regulation.},

  abstract = {Although up to 25\% of glucose released into circulation in the postabsorptive state comes from renal gluconeogenesis, the regulatory mechanisms of this process are still poorly recognized, comparing to hepatic ones. The aim of the present study was to examine if hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) might be involved in the regulation of glucose de novo synthesis in kidneys. It was found that HK-2~cells (immortalized human kidney proximal tubules, capable of gluconeogenesis/glycogen synthesis) cultured with gluconeogenic substrates either in hypoxia (1\% O2) or in the presence of DMOG (an inhibitor of HIF-1Î± degradation) exhibited increased glycogen content. This phenomenon was not correlated with augmented glucose intake and the effects were reversed by echinomycin (an inhibitor of HIF-1 binding to HRE sequence). As concluded from the measurement of the intracellular content of gluconeogenic intermediates followed by Western blot analysis, under conditions of hypoxia/increased HIF-1 level the activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was elevated, as a result of increased expression of the cytosolic isoform of PEPCK (PEPCK-C). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis proved HIF-1 ability to bind to the promoter region of PEPCK-C gene. The final conclusion that hypoxia/HIF-1 accelerates the rate of renal glucogenesis via the mechanism engaging activation of PEPCK-C expression might be useful in terms of e.g. diabetes treatment, as it is commonly accepted that under diabetic conditions kidneys and liver seem to be equally important sources of glucose synthesized de novo.},

This transcription factor not only favors cell proliferation through the metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and lactic acid production but also stimulates nutrient supply by mediating adaptive survival mechanisms. In this study we showed that glycogen synthesis is enhanced in non-cancer and cancer cells when exposed to hypoxia, resulting in a large increase in glycogen stores. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mRNA and protein levels of the first enzyme of glycogenesis, phosphoglucomutase1 (PGM1), were increased in hypoxia. We showed that induction of glycogen storage as well as PGM1 expression were dependent on HIF-1 and HIF-2. We established that hypoxia-induced glycogen stores are rapidly mobilized in cells that are starved of glucose. Glycogenolysis allows these "hypoxia-preconditioned" cells to confront and survive glucose deprivation. In contrast normoxic control cells exhibit a high rate of cell death following glucose removal. These findings point to the important role of hypoxia and HIF in inducing mechanisms of rapid adaptation and survival in response to a decrease in oxygen tension. We propose that a decrease in pO(2) acts as an "alarm" that prepares the cells to face subsequent nutrient depletion and to survive.},

  abstract = {Lactate, perhaps the best-known metabolic waste product, was first isolated from sour milk, in which it is produced by lactobacilli. Whereas microbes also generate other fermentation products, such as ethanol or acetone, lactate dominates in mammals. Lactate production increases when the demand for ATP and oxygen exceeds supply, as occurs during intense exercise and ischaemia. The build-up of lactate in stressed muscle and ischaemic tissues has established lactate's reputation as a deleterious waste product. In this Perspective, we summarize emerging evidence that, in mammals, lactate also serves as a major circulating carbohydrate fuel. By providing mammalian cells with both a convenient source and sink for three-carbon compounds, circulating lactate enables the uncoupling of carbohydrate-driven mitochondrial energy generation from glycolysis. Lactate and pyruvate together serve as a circulating redox buffer that equilibrates the NADH/NAD ratio across cells and tissues. This reconceptualization of lactate as a fuel-analogous to how Hans Christian Andersen's ugly duckling is actually a beautiful swan-has the potential to reshape the field of energy metabolism.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

We show that Myc is destroyed by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and define two elements in Myc that oppositely regulate its stability: a transcriptional activation domain that promotes Myc destruction, and a region required for association with the POZ domain protein Miz-1 that stabilizes Myc. We also show that Myc is stabilized by cancer-associated and transforming mutations within its transcriptional activation domain. Our data reveal a complex network of interactions regulating Myc destruction, and imply that enhanced protein stability contributes to oncogenic transformation by mutant Myc proteins.},

Here we acquire this insight in a melanoma cell line panel by tracking metabolic flux using isotopically labeled nutrients. Metabolic profiling and flux balance analysis were used to compare normal melanocytes to melanoma cell lines in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. All melanoma cells exhibited the Warburg phenomenon; they used more glucose and produced more lactate than melanocytes. Other changes were observed in melanoma cells that are not described by the Warburg phenomenon. Hypoxic conditions increased fermentation of glucose to lactate in both melanocytes and melanoma cells (the Pasteur effect). However, metabolism was not strictly glycolytic, as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was functional in all melanoma lines, even under hypoxia. Furthermore, glutamine was also a key nutrient providing a substantial anaplerotic contribution to the TCA cycle. In the WM35 melanoma line glutamine was metabolized in the "reverse" (reductive) direction in the TCA cycle, particularly under hypoxia. This reverse flux allowed the melanoma cells to synthesize fatty acids from glutamine while glucose was primarily converted to lactate. Altogether, this study, which is the first comprehensive comparative analysis of metabolism in melanoma cells, provides a foundation for targeting metabolism for therapeutic benefit in melanoma.},

We have extended these observations by investigating two N-terminal phosphorylation sites in Myc, Thr 58 and Ser 62, which are known to be regulated by mitogen stimulation. We now show that the phosphorylation of these two residues is critical for determining the stability of Myc. Phosphorylation of Ser 62 is required for Ras-induced stabilization of Myc, likely mediated through the action of ERK. Conversely, phosphorylation of Thr 58, likely mediated by GSK-3 but dependent on the prior phosphorylation of Ser 62, is associated with degradation of Myc. Further analysis demonstrates that the Ras-dependent PI-3K pathway is also critical for controlling Myc protein accumulation, likely through the control of GSK-3 activity. These observations thus define a synergistic role for multiple Ras-mediated phosphorylation pathways in the control of Myc protein accumulation during the initial stage of cell proliferation.},

  abstract = {The MYC oncogene encodes a transcription factor, MYC, whose broad effects make its precise oncogenic role enigmatically elusive. The evidence to date suggests that MYC triggers selective gene expression amplification to promote cell growth and proliferation. Through its targets, MYC coordinates nutrient acquisition to produce ATP and key cellular building blocks that increase cell mass and trigger DNA replication and cell division. In cancer, genetic and epigenetic derangements silence checkpoints and unleash MYC's cell growth- and proliferation-promoting metabolic activities. Unbridled growth in response to deregulated MYC expression creates dependence on MYC-driven metabolic pathways, such that reliance on specific metabolic enzymes provides novel targets for cancer therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: MYC's expression and activity are tightly regulated in normal cells by multiple mechanisms, including a dependence upon growth factor stimulation and replete nutrient status. In cancer, genetic deregulation of MYC expression and loss of checkpoint components, such as TP53, permit MYC to drive malignant transformation. However, because of the reliance of MYC-driven cancers on specific metabolic pathways, synthetic lethal interactions between MYC overexpression and specific enzyme inhibitors provide novel cancer therapeutic opportunities.},

Treatment of the cells with milimolar concentrations (5 and 10~mM) of Pro for 24 and 48~h contributed to increase in Î±1 subunit of collagen type I (COL1A1) expression in both cells and culture medium. However, the effect was more pronounced in glutamine-free medium. In such condition, Pro induced collagen expression by about twofold in the cells, while in the medium only by about 30\% during 24~h incubation, compared to control. In the presence of glutamine (Gln), exogenous Pro stimulated intracellular collagen expression only by about 30\% during 24~h of fibroblasts incubation, and it was not accompanied by adequate increase of collagen secretion into medium. Gln alone stimulated the processes by about 2-3 fold during the course of the experiment. Pro-dependent increase in collagen expression in Gln-free medium was accompanied by increase in prolidase activity and expression of pAkt. In both Gln-free medium and Gln-supplemented medium, Pro induced expression of p53 and HIF-1Î±. The data suggest that availability of Gln, as a substrate for Pro biosynthesis, determine the utilization of exogenous Pro for the collagen biosynthesis.},

This accumulation may be prevented (and also reverted) by allowing the diffusible end products lactate and pyruvate to leave the cell by equilibrating with a much larger extracellular compartment. The disturbance of erythrocyte glycolysis does not result from direct inhibition by lactate itself but from the interplay between the lactate dehydrogenase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (3-PGAD) reactions. The accumulation of intermediates reflects the increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio; this leads to a secondary imbalance of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-to-reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD-to-NADH) ratio, which in turn slows down glycolysis at the 3-PGAD step, whose upstream metabolites then pile up. No accumulation, however, takes place if the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio is maintained constant in the extracellular compartment, regardless of concentrations. These studies demonstrate that orderly glycolysis in the erythrocyte is regulated by the NAD-to-NADH ratio and also provide a method that makes possible the in vitro study of erythrocyte glycolysis.},

To characterize changes in mitochondrial substrate utilization in the context of compromised mitochondrial pyruvate transport, we applied (13)C metabolic flux analysis (MFA) to cells after transcriptional or pharmacological inhibition of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Despite profound suppression of both glucose and pyruvate oxidation, cell growth, oxygen consumption, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism were surprisingly maintained. Oxidative TCA flux was achieved through enhanced reliance on glutaminolysis through malic enzyme and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) as well as fatty acid and branched-chain amino acid oxidation. Thus, in contrast to inhibition of complex I or PDH, suppression of pyruvate transport induces a form of metabolic flexibility associated with the use of lipids and amino acids as catabolic and anabolic fuels.},

Down-regulation of c-MYC, reduced cell growth, and decreased activity of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signal transduction pathway are features of the terminal differentiation of committed myeloid precursors to polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Since mTORC1 regulates growth, we hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin may reverse the phenotypic effects of c-MYC. Here we show that granulocytes blocked in their ability to differentiate by enforced expression of c-MYC can be induced to differentiate by reducing exogenous c-MYC expression through rapamycin treatment. Rapamycin also reduced expression of endogenous c-MYC and resulted in enhanced retinoid-induced differentiation. Total cellular c-Myc mRNA and c-MYC protein stability were unchanged by rapamycin, however the amount of c-Myc mRNA associated with polysomes was reduced. Therefore rapamycin limited expression of c-MYC by inhibiting c-Myc mRNA translation. These findings suggest that mTORC1 could be targeted to promote terminal differentiation in myeloid malignancies characterized by dysregulated expression of c-MYC.},

If and how other proteins cooperate with IGF2BP1 in promoting stabilization of the c-myc mRNA via the CRD remained elusive. Here, we identify various RNA-binding proteins that associate with IGF2BP1 in an RNA-dependent fashion. Four of these proteins (HNRNPU, SYNCRIP, YBX1, and DHX9) were essential to ensure stabilization of the c-myc mRNA via the CRD. These factors associate with IGF2BP1 in a CRD-dependent manner, co-distribute with IGF2BP1 in non-polysomal fractions comprising c-myc mRNA, and colocalize with IGF2BP1 in the cytoplasm. A selective shift of relative c-myc mRNA levels to the polysomal fraction is observed upon IGF2BP1 knockdown. These findings suggest that IGF2BP1 in complex with at least four proteins promotes CRD-mediated mRNA stabilization. Complex formation at the CRD presumably limits the transfer of c-myc mRNA to the polysomal fraction and subsequent translation-coupled decay.},

Hypoxia diminishes ATP production in part by lowering the activity of the electron transport chain through activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1. The decrease in electron transport limits the overproduction of reactove oxygen species during hypoxia and slows the rate of oxygen depletion to prevent anoxia.

  abstract = {Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) deals with the experimental determination of steady-state fluxes in metabolic networks. An important feature of the (13)C MFA method is its capability to generate information on both directions of bidirectional reaction steps given by exchange fluxes. The biological interpretation of these exchange fluxes and their relation to thermodynamic properties of the respective reaction steps has never been systematically investigated. As a central result, it is shown here that for a general class of enzyme reaction mechanisms the quotients of net and exchange fluxes measured by (13)C MFA are coupled to Gibbs energies of the reaction steps. To establish this relation the concept of apparent flux ratios of enzymatic isotope-labeling networks is introduced and some computing rules for these flux ratios are given. Application of these rules reveals a conceptional pitfall of (13)C MFA, which is the inherent dependency of measured exchange fluxes on the chosen tracer atom. However, it is shown that this effect can be neglected for typical biochemical reaction steps under physiological conditions. In this situation, the central result can be formulated as a two-sided inequality relating fluxes, pool sizes, and standard Gibbs energies. This relation has far-reaching consequences for metabolic flux analysis, quantitative metabolomics, and network thermodynamics.},

Since data related to the importance of HIF1 and 2 in hematopoietic stem and progenitors is conflicting, we investigated the chromatin binding profiles of HIF1 and HIF2 and linked that to transcriptional networks and the cellular metabolic state. METHODS: Genome-wide ChIPseq and ChIP-PCR experiments were performed to identify HIF1 and HIF2 binding sites in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and healthy CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Transcriptome studies were performed to identify gene expression changes induced by hypoxia or by overexpression of oxygen-insensitive HIF1 and HIF2 mutants. Metabolism studies were performed by 1D-NMR, and glucose consumption and lactate production levels were determined by spectrophotometric enzyme assays. CRISPR-CAS9-mediated HIF1, HIF2, and ARNT-/- lines were generated to study the functional consequences upon loss of HIF signaling, in vitro and in vivo upon transplantation of knockout lines in xenograft mice. RESULTS: Genome-wide ChIP-seq and transcriptome studies revealed that overlapping HIF1- and HIF2-controlled loci were highly enriched for various processes including metabolism, particularly glucose metabolism, but also for chromatin organization, cellular response to stress and G protein-coupled receptor signaling. ChIP-qPCR validation studies confirmed that glycolysis-related genes but not genes related to the TCA cycle or glutaminolysis were controlled by both HIF1 and HIF2 in leukemic cell lines and primary AMLs, while in healthy human CD34+ cells these loci were predominantly controlled by HIF1 and not HIF2. However, and in contrast to our initial hypotheses, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of HIF signaling did not affect growth, internal metabolite concentrations, glucose consumption or lactate production under hypoxia, not even in vivo upon transplantation of knockout cells into xenograft mice. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that, while HIFs exert control over glycolysis but not OxPHOS gene expression in human leukemic cells, this is not critically important for their metabolic state. In contrast, inhibition of BCR-ABL did impact on glucose consumption and lactate production regardless of the presence of HIFs. These data indicate that oncogene-mediated control over glycolysis can occur independently of hypoxic signaling modules.},

  abstract = {Citrate is a critical metabolite required to support both mitochondrial bioenergetics and cytosolic macromolecular synthesis. When cells proliferate under normoxic conditions, glucose provides the acetyl-CoA that condenses with oxaloacetate to support citrate production. Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle anaplerosis is maintained primarily by glutamine. Here we report that some hypoxic cells are able to maintain cell proliferation despite a profound reduction in glucose-dependent citrate production. In these hypoxic cells, glutamine becomes a major source of citrate. Glutamine-derived Î±-ketoglutarate is reductively carboxylated by the NADPH-linked mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) to form isocitrate, which can then be isomerized to citrate. The increased IDH2-dependent carboxylation of glutamine-derived Î±-ketoglutarate in hypoxia is associated with a concomitant increased synthesis of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in cells with wild-type IDH1 and IDH2. When either starved of glutamine or rendered IDH2-deficient by RNAi, hypoxic cells are unable to proliferate. The reductive carboxylation of glutamine is part of the metabolic reprogramming associated with hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), as constitutive activation of HIF1 recapitulates the preferential reductive metabolism of glutamine-derived Î±-ketoglutarate even in normoxic conditions. These data support a role for glutamine carboxylation in maintaining citrate synthesis and cell growth under hypoxic conditions.},

  abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)/reduced NAD+ (NADH) and NADP+/reduced NADP+ (NADPH) redox couples are essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and for modulating numerous biological events, including cellular metabolism. Deficiency or imbalance of these two redox couples has been associated with many pathological disorders. Recent Advances: Newly identified biosynthetic enzymes and newly developed genetically encoded biosensors enable us to understand better how cells maintain compartmentalized NAD(H) and NADP(H) pools. The concept of redox stress (oxidative and reductive stress) reflected by changes in NAD(H)/NADP(H) has increasingly gained attention. The emerging roles of NAD+-consuming proteins in regulating cellular redox and metabolic homeostasis are active research topics. CRITICAL ISSUES: The biosynthesis and distribution of cellular NAD(H) and NADP(H) are highly compartmentalized. It is critical to understand how cells maintain the steady levels of these redox couple pools to ensure their normal functions and simultaneously avoid inducing redox stress. In addition, it is essential to understand how NAD(H)- and NADP(H)-utilizing enzymes interact with other signaling pathways, such as those regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor, to maintain cellular redox homeostasis and energy metabolism. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Additional studies are needed to investigate the inter-relationships among compartmentalized NAD(H)/NADP(H) pools and how these two dinucleotide redox couples collaboratively regulate cellular redox states and cellular metabolism under normal and pathological conditions. Furthermore, recent studies suggest the utility of using pharmacological interventions or nutrient-based bioactive NAD+ precursors as therapeutic interventions for metabolic diseases. Thus, a better understanding of the cellular functions of NAD(H) and NADP(H) may facilitate efforts to address a host of pathological disorders effectively. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 28, 251-272.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation is one of the hallmark features of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. With only supportive treatment options available for this life-threatening disease, treating and preventing the proliferation of PASMCs is a viable therapeutic option. A key promoter of hypoxia-induced increases in the number of viable human PASMCs is arginase II, with attenuation of viable cell numbers following pharmacologic inhibition or siRNA knockdown of the enzyme. Additionally, increased levels of arginase have been demonstrated in the pulmonary vasculature of patients with pulmonary hypertension. The signaling pathways responsible for the hypoxic induction of arginase II in PASMCs, however, remain unknown. Hypoxia is a recognized activator of AMPK, which is known to be expressed in human PASMCs (hPASMCs). Activation of AMPK by hypoxia has been shown to promote cell survival in PASMCs. In addition, pharmacologic agents targeting AMPK have been shown to attenuate chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension in animal models. The present studies tested the hypothesis that hypoxia-induced arginase II expression in hPASMCs is mediated through AMPK signaling. We found that pharmacologic inhibitors of AMPK, as well as siRNA knockdown of AMPKÎ±1, prevented hypoxia-induced arginase II. The hypoxia-induced increase in viable hPASMC numbers was also prevented following both pharmacologic inhibition and siRNA knockdown of AMPK. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of AMPK induced arginase II protein expression and viable cells numbers in hPASMCs.},

  abstract = {In this article the metabolic flux analysis of growing CHO-320 cells is performed for a detailed metabolic network which involves 100 reactions and embraces all the significant pathways describing the metabolism of CHO cells. The purpose is to investigate the efficiency of the flux analysis when it is based on a relatively small set of extracellular measurements that can be easily achieved in most laboratories. In this case the flux analysis problem leads to a generally underdetermined mass balance system, as data are not sufficient to uniquely define the metabolic fluxes. Our main contribution is to show that, provided the system of mass balance equations is well-posed, although it is underdetermined, very narrow intervals may be found for most fluxes. The importance of checking the well-posedness of the problem is emphasized and the influence of the number of available measurements on the accuracy of the metabolic flux intervals is systematically investigated. In all cases the computed flux intervals are bounded and a single well defined value is obtained for the formation rates of the cellular macromolecules (proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids) that are not measured. The potential gain of a simple theoretical assumption regarding the metabolism of Threonine is also discussed and compared with an optimal solution calculated by maximizing the biomass formation rate. Alternative network structures obtained by inverting the direction of reversible reactions are also considered. Finally, the results of the metabolic flux analysis are exploited to estimate the total energy production resulting from the metabolism of growing CHO-320 cells.},

The molecular mechanisms underlying this metabolic reprogramming are unclear. Here we show that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) negatively regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and O(2) consumption in renal carcinoma cells lacking the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL). HIF-1 mediates these effects by inhibiting C-MYC activity via two mechanisms. First, HIF-1 binds to and activates transcription of the MXI1 gene, which encodes a repressor of C-MYC transcriptional activity. Second, HIF-1 promotes MXI-1-independent, proteasome-dependent degradation of C-MYC. We demonstrate that transcription of the gene encoding the coactivator PGC-1beta is C-MYC dependent and that loss of PGC-1beta expression is a major factor contributing to reduced respiration in VHL-deficient renal carcinoma cells.},

Functionally, based on transient knockdowns and overexpression, our data delineate a c-Myc/Hif-1alpha-dependent pathway mediating vascular endothelial growth factor production and secretion. The antiangiogenic activity of our tool compound, adaphostin, was subsequently shown in a zebrafish model and translated into a preclinical in vitro and in vivo model of MM in the bone marrow milieu.

  abstract = {AIMS: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a proliferative disorder characterized by enhanced proliferation and suppressed apoptosis of intrapulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells. Recently, network-based bioinformatics have identified let-7 family, a tumor suppressive microRNA, regulate multiple interacting targets relevant to PH. However, the role of let-7 in vascular homeostasis in PH remains unknown. Thus, we wanted to investigate the role of let-7 in hypoxia-induced PASMCs proliferation and the underlying mechanism in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH). MAIN METHODS: The male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to hypoxia (10\% O2) for 21days to induce HPH. The expression of let-7 was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. Primary rat PASMCs were exposed to hypoxia (3\% O2). MTS and EDU were performed to evaluate PASMCs proliferation. The mRNA and protein expression of c-myc, Bmi-1 and p16 were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The functions of let-7g on PASMCs proliferation, c-myc, Bmi-1 and p16 expression were assessed by let-7g mimic and inhibitor transfection. KEY FINDINGS: Among let-7 family members, only let-7b and let-7g were significantly down-regulated in remodeled pulmonary artery in HPH rats. Furthermore, only let-7g level was decreased in hypoxic PASMCs. Either hypoxia or let-7g inhibitor stimulated proliferation of PASMCs, let-7g mimic inhibited hypoxia-induced PASMCs proliferation. C-myc was the target of let-7g in PASMCs. Transfect of let-7g mimic inhibited hypoxia-induced c-myc, Bmi-1 up-regulation and p16 down-regulation, which ultimately controls cell cycle progression. SIGNIFICANCE: Loss of inhibition on c-myc-Bmi-1-p16 signaling pathway by let-7g may lead to PASMCs proliferation and vascular remodeling in HPH.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs have been considered to participate in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and regulate numerous disease pathways in pulmonary vasculature. However, the molecular role in the pathologies has not yet been fully uncovered, particularly in the view of energy metabolism and vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic regulation. Here, several altered miRNAs are founded in genome-wide miRNA sequencing analysis, in which miR-449a-5p was identified as a probable candidate in hypoxic PAH and verified such a decreasing trend. Moreover, we identify that miR-449a-5p plays critical role in both mitochondria metabolic dysfunction and phenotype transformation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. Subsequently, we initiate that the transcription factor Myc, which is negatively regulated by miR-449a-5p, results in the aberrant effects contributing to pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. Taken together, we demonstrated that the miR-449a-5p/Myc axis is indispensable for the development and progression of PAH. These results may serve as a significant implication for understanding and treatment of PAH. KEY MESSAGES: â¢ The downregulation of miR-449a-5p occurs in both PAH-PAs and hypoxic PASMCs. â¢ MiR-449a-5p is involved in hypoxia-induced mitochondria dysfunction of PASMCs. â¢ MiR-449a-5p inhibits hypoxic phenotypic transition and proliferation of PASMCs. â¢ The aberrant effects of MiR-449a-5p depend on downstream transcription factor Myc. â¢ Myc contributes to mitochondria dysfunction and phenotype transformation in PAH.},
